I recently received my M.S. in Robotics degree from [The Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently I'm a research assistant here at the [Intelligent Autonomous Manipulation (IAM) Lab](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/iam/), and I'm advised by Professor [Oliver Kroemer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/).

My research interest mainly lies in robotic manipulatio and robot learning. 
Over the past few years, I have been working on reducing uncertainties for robotic assembly tasks by learning precise and task-oriented grasps, and learning contact-rich manipulation tasks by exploring hierarchical controllers.
Several topics that I'm interested in:
(1) Guiding learning algorithms in semi-structured environment.
(2) Leveraging analytical methods in robot learning.
(3) Learning from multi-sensory inputs for novel actuators.

Before joining CMU, I spent one year as a undergrad researcher at UC Berkeley [HART Lab](http://hart.berkeley.edu/). 
I worked on modelling and designing controllers for an active [Upper Limb Exoskeleton](http://hart.berkeley.edu/exoskeletons.html) under supervision of Professor [Ruzena Bajcsy](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bajcsy/).

I'm also a passionate travel photographer. Checkout [www.alanz.info](http://www.alanz.info) for my blogs & portfolio! :)
