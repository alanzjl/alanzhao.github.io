After getting trapped deeper and deeper into this hobby I finally started looking at my mount and thinking about replacing it... (Sirius EQ-G and I've only been in this hobby for 3 months!) I really appreciate the EQ-G's relatively light weight and fear that a heavier mount might destroy my enthusiasm.

As a mechanical engineer (well not really, I really work more on control/learning stuff:) what can be more fun than building one by myself? So I ordered two HDs off eBay for ~\$400 (the same model sells for ~\$1.3k new each). 

## What is HarmonicDrive and why using it?

HDs, or more accurately speaking, strain wave gearing, is a kind of gearing mechanism that generates much more torque than other common gearing (because it has much more teeth engaged at a time), while having basically zero backlash (because it utilizes deformation - kind of similar to belts which are believed to be more or less backlash-less but HDs use deformable spring metal which is better than belts even if they are filled with steel) - or, tldr: it can drive much heavier load WITHOUT the need of counterweights! 

Here is a nice GIF of how strain wave gearing works

and here is a youtube video from HarmonicDrive that tells more details

## (07/04) Design

I have mostly finished the drawing of the metal backbone.
Most of the parts will be made with 1/4" and 3/8" 6061 aluminum alloy.
I'm trying to make the design such that I can waterjet as many parts as possible - I do have access to several really good Haas CNC machines at MIT, but I'm not sure if it's totally okay if I use them for my DIY projects (however, according to the lab manager: "technically what you make here should be for your research but what you do is none of my business" plus a wink.)
The current design is all waterjet-able except the dovetail clamp.

Hopefully I'll be free enough next week to start making some chips! (well not really, since they will mostly be waterjetted:)

## (07/07) PCB

I finally finished the PCB design, and sent it to JLCPCB to manufacture... 
It was based on the design of the MiniPCB2 from OnStep, however even the MiniPCB has a "Mini" in its name, it's still too big.
My design has two TMC2130 stepper drivers, one PEC (Periodic Error Correction) switch connector, two extra endstop switches, a RJ11 (6 pin telescope port) connector for a hand controller.
The microcontroller is a Teensy 4.0.
Should be sufficiently fast.
It doesn't have a WiFi module built in but I put a connector there in case I decide to add one in the future - but I really can't think of a reason for it now.

## 3D Printed Shells

Here is my first attempt to design a shell for my mount's skeleton - well I admit it's a bit ugly...
Too boxy, I guess.
You can see the housing for the PCB on the RA axis.

Everything weights about 5.5kg now - 4 kg for the sheleton plus motors plus gears, 1 kg for bolts (lol), and the rest for the 4mm shells printed with ABS.

## Waterjet first attempt

Okay I admit this is actually my first time to use a waterjet - after I finished all the design that was built around waterjetting. 
Probably should have tested it before designing everything.
Fortunately the result turns out to be very good.
I'm very happy with the dimensional accuracy - the error is within 0.1mm.
The only issue is that the cut is not 100% vertical.
The bottom surface is about 0.1mm longer than the top surface on a 3/8" (or ~10mm) piece.
Not good but not too bad. 
I'll worry a bit about squareness but it should be fine since I have a lot of reinforcements.

Removing the pieces and sanding the tabs are painful.
Now I learned that one tab is really sufficient for a 10mm plate.

Okay now that waterjetting works, I placed the order for almost everything.
My new 1/4" aluminum plates should arrive next week.
