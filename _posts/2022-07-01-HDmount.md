After getting trapped deeper and deeper into this hobby I finally started looking at my mount and thinking about replacing it... (Sirius EQ-G and I've only been in this hobby for 3 months!) I really appreciate the EQ-G's relatively light weight and fear that a heavier mount might destroy my enthusiasm. So I was looking at mounts built with HarmonicDrives. HDs, or more accurately speaking, strain wave gearing, is a kind of gearing mechanism that generates much more torque than other common gearing (because it has much more teeth engaged at a time), while having basically zero backlash (because it utilizes deformation - kind of similar to belts which are believed to be more or less backlash-less but HDs use deformable spring metal which is better than belts even if they are filled with steel) - or, tldr: it can drive much heavier load WITHOUT the need of counterweights! 

As a mechanical engineer (well not really, I really work more on control stuff:) what can be more fun than building one by myself? So I ordered two HDs off eBay for ~$400 (the same model sells for ~$1.3k new each).
